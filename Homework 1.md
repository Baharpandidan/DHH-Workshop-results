This move can only be performed under specific conditions, as follows:  Conditions for the En Passant Move:  Pawn Movement: This move is only possible when an opponent's pawn moves two squares forward and lands beside your pawn.  Positioning: The opponent's pawn must be adjacent to your pawn, meaning it must be in an adjacent file.  Time Limit: You can only make this move on your next turn. If you miss that turn and make a different move, you forfeit the right to use en passant.  How to Execute the Move:  If the opponent's pawn moves two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture the opponent's pawn horizontally (in the adjacent file) and move your pawn to the square where the opponent's pawn was located. This indicates that you have captured the opponent's pawn "en passant."  Example:  Suppose the opponent's pawn moves from e7 to e5, and your pawn is on d5. You can move your pawn from d5 to e6 to capture the opponent's pawn.  This move helps prevent pawns from escaping and adds more variety to the game. I hope this explanation is helpful! If you have any other questions, I would be happy to assist."|Yes|No|
